# Project Euler Solutions

 This is nothing but my personal attempt to solve all of the [mathematical problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives) listed in  [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) using .Net and hopefully python (Not a promise)

 One (or two) problems a day, or none if I found them too difficult.

 You are free to read the code, and see what the answer is. But remember:
"There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time"
